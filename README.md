Hey there!
This is just our year-long senior project for ADR, in which we're making an app with various minigames (all in which are existing/inspired by existing games)
that is intended to help users challenge and strengthen their cognitive skills, such as quick thinking, memorization, and reaction time.
We wanted to incorporte the concept of Left v. Right brain as well. :)
